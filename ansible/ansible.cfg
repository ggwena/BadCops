# User config file for ansible - ~/.ansible.cfg
# ==============================================
# nearly all parameters can be overridden in ansible-playbook 
# or with command line flags. ansible will read ANSIBLE_CONFIG,
# ansible.cfg in the current working directory, .ansible.cfg in
# the home directory or /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg, whichever it
# finds first

# smart gathering of FACTS, instead of implicit
#gathering = smart

# additional paths to search for roles in, colon separated
roles_path    = $HOME/BadCops/ansible/roles

# if set, always use this private key file for authentication, same as 
# if passing --private-key to ansible or ansible-playbook
